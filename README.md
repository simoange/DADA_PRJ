An economic analysis
Our project aims to provide a clear, data-driven view of European economic dynamics from 2014 to 2024, leveraging a scientific and rigorous approach.
We used official data provided by EUROSTAT, which were meticulously cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using advanced data analytics tools, ensuring reliable and meaningful results.
By analyzing key economic and labor market indicators, we strive to make a tangible contribution to understanding the challenges and opportunities that shape the European landscape, promoting sustainable and inclusive growth.
